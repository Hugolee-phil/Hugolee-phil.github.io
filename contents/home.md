I am now a PhD student at the School of Chinese at the University of Hong Kong. Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Shandong University and my Master's degree in Chinese Philosophy from Fudan University. My research interests are in moral psychology, Confucian moral philosophy (Mencius and Xunzi), and modern Chinese philosophy.
